# OpenResearch
OpenResearch aims to bring deepsearch like capabilities to people who do not have access to Open AIs 200 USD subscription nor the computing power to run Deepseek-r1 locally.


## what
[Deep research](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10500283-deep-research-faq) by Open AI is pretty impressive for tasks such as researching about fields that require extensive knowledge on almost all subdomains of said field, such as finance, law, statistics, etc. However, OpenAI being OpenAI has closed sourced this model like all their other models after GPT-2. Also it's only available to pro users for 200 USD/Month.
Another alternative would be the Deepseek-r1 series of LLMs that have reasoning and are open source, however their most competent model requires huge amounts of computing powers to give a satisfactory user experience.

This repo aims to solve these issues by providing a platform for users to self host such a system without having to worry about cost or compute power.
